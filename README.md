# Project Basics
## Project title
: SaraKIT
## Project teaser
: Raspberry Pi expansion board that adds advanced voice control, precise motor control and various sensors for robotics and AI projects.

# Details About Your Product
## A simple paragraph or two describing your product

SaraKIT is a Raspberry Pi CM4 expansion board that enables advanced voice control and precise motor control. It features three sensitive microphones with sound localization for voice recognition up to 5m away, two independent BLDC motor controllers providing quiet, fast and precise control for gimbal motors, CSI interface with two cameras on a flexible cable, two accelerometers, a gyroscope, and a temperature sensor. In short, SaraKIT is a versatile solution for those who want to build modern and efficient voice-controlled products, robots, and interact with smart home or office devices.

## A ballpark estimate of the product price
- 149$ ?

we plan to sell SaraKIT in a boxed version, but we are also thinking about selling it with an additional casing in 3 versions?

# Details About Your Project
## A paragraph describing several use-cases for your product

We provide a ready-made solution and many examples, but the imagination and creativity of the user determine the range of applications:

## SaraKIT with ChatGPT
Using our SaraKIT electronics, we can build a device with ChatGPT support in a housing printed on a 3D printer with the function of tracking and recognition the user's face:<br>

<img src="https://sarakit.saraai.com/images/_pan_tilt/DSC02853.JPG" width=48%><br>
the operation of the device is shown in this video:<br>
![SaraEye](https://saraai.com/_SaraEye/Movies/SaraEyeWithChatGPT_en.mp4)<br>
Of course, for simple integration with ChatGPT, the PCB itself is enough, without cameras, motors, or special housing.

## Support for Alexa and Google Home
but on a look-only basis (no wake words "Alexa" or "ok Google":<br>

## SaraKIT with BLDC Gimbal Motor Demo (FOC)
This example shows how to control motor speed, torque and angle of BLDC gimbal motors using the Field Oriented Control (FOC) algorithm (or not) in C++/Python.<br>
![bldc](https://saraai.com/_SaraKIT/video/SaraKIT_BLDC_Gimbal_Motors.mp4)<br>
BLDC motors have become increasingly popular due to their smooth operation, high torque, and precise control. In this guide, we will explore the use of BLDC motors using SaraKIT, and compare them to other commonly used motors such as stepper motors and servos.<br><br>
In this video, I demonstrate how easy it is to control BLDC gimbal motors, and also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of solutions based on servos or stepper motors. I also show the difference in controlling gimbal motors that have a decoder and those that do not.<br><br>
Gimbal motors with a decoder are controlled using the Field Oriented Control (FOC) algorithm. The condensed knowledge presented here is based on many materials from the internet, such as the "Simple Field Oriented Control BLDC driver" for Arduino systems. In future videos, we will show how to use gimbal control to create a self-balancing robot, RC car, precise Pan/Tilt camera control, or creating a voice assistant based on Amazon Alexa, Google Home, or ChatGPT that does not require continuous calling of the keyword "Alexa...", but just looking at it.<br><br>
![changetomp4](https://sarakit.saraai.com/images/SaraKIT_field_oriented_control_FOC.gif)
Code examples in Pascal and C++ is created for Raspberry Pi 4 in CM4 version. SaraKIT requires 12-24VDC min. 20W when you use motors in your project, you should use a correspondingly larger power supply. For mobile devices, we recommend a simple connection to the PowerBank (PD2.0 PD3.0 Fast Charging and QC4 with USB-C output) with a special PD 12v cable. Or by connecting a USB cable via USB-C Pd Trigger Module Pd 12v.

This movie showcases one of the applications of SaraKIT, an extension kit for Raspberry Pi 4 in CM4 version.

The SaraKIT kit includes most of the necessary elements:
- Two FOC gimbal motor drivers for BLDC motors
- An accelerometer with a gyroscope
- Support for motor encoders
- 3 sensitive microphones for voice control
- Two camera outputs for live streaming from a moving vehicle
- The ability to connect power from easily available Power Banks (PD2.0 PD3.0 Fast Charging and QC4 with USB-C output) with a special PD 12v cable or by connecting a USB cable via USB-C Pd Trigger Module Pd 12v.

Additionally, you will need two BLDC gimbal motors, two encoders, two motor-to-brick adapters, and some building blocks. The design of the vehicle is up to you. The brick adapters can be easily 3D-printed (the relevant stl and obj files are included on our website) or purchased for a few dollars from our site.

This robot demonstrates the power of BLDC gimbal motors; it is very difficult to overturn, quiet, and fast, and does not require heavy loads to be placed high up.

You can find C++ and Python code for Raspberry Pi4 in the
SaraKIT Github repository
